# Employment Center Analysis

By Mike Smith, Manav Dixit, Kelvin Nguyen, and Kelly Luu

## Summary

This repo contains analysis notebooks, which have been converted into python files for convenience. Each python file generates a csv file, containing some form of summary statistic or map to be visualized on the SANDAG internal platform.

The Output can be re-generated by running the run.py file while using the conda environment specified in environment.yml.

Before running run.py, ensure that your environment is correct and the necessary data has been downloaded from the Census Bureau and the SANDAG Open Data Portal

## To generate the export

### Run the run.sh file

This file will download the required data, activate the conda environment, and generate the exports to the output/ folder. Anaconda needs to be installed before running this script.

Simply run `sh run.sh` on Mac, or `bash run.sh` on windows.

This may take awhile to run, as it will download all required dependencies, data, and execute python code.
