# Employment Center Analysis

By Mike Smith, Manav Dixit, Kelvin Nguyen, and Kelly Luu

## Summary

This repo contains analysis notebooks, which have been converted into python files for convenience. Each python file generates a csv file, containing some form of summary statistic or map to be visualized on the SANDAG internal platform.

The Output can be re-generated by running the run.sh file.

## To generate the export

### Run the run.sh file

This file will download the required data, activate the conda environment, and generate the exports to the output/ folder. Anaconda needs to be installed before running this script.

Simply run `sh run.sh` on Mac, or `bash run.sh` on windows.

This may take awhile to run, as it will download all required dependencies, data, and execute python code.
